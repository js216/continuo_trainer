# Continuo

This is a highly engaging web-based musical game designed to teach how to
realize basso continuo from traditional notation. It transforms real-time
musical skill execution into a fast, rewarding loop to redirect the attention
that would otherwise go to passive media consumption towards mastering a musical
skill.

To make skill-building as compelling as social media, we use dynamic
audio-visual feedback, surprise, anticipation, streaks, progression cues,
variable rewards, social comparison, and fantasy identity framing. Over time,
challenges escalate from single chords to extended continuo lines, simple fugal
improvisation, and ultimately full orchestral accompaniment.

In short: it's a compulsively playable musical "skill machine" that turns the
addictive mechanics of modern media into rapid, focused, and creative music
practice.

### Stage 2 — Variable Rewards & Early Feedback

- Check for contrary motion, and specially flag parallel 5ths
- Implement variable-ratio reward system (small/none/medium/jackpot)
- Audio flourishes of varying lengths for rewards
- Visual cues for correct input and reward types
- Display per-lessons stats obtained from back-end
- Streak multiplier basics

### Stage 3 — Short Sequences & Challenge Escalation

- Generate 2–4 chord sequences
- Introduce timing pressure per chord
- Unlock slightly more complex figures for jackpots
- Implement progression feedback (XP, points, streaks)
- Track fastest completion times per sequence

### Stage 4 — Progression & Collectibles

- Introduce rare collectible items (ornaments, timbres, historical figures)
- Unlock new rewards based on streaks and performance
- Add leaderboard placeholders (local for MVP)
- Refine variable-ratio jackpot probabilities
- Audio/visual reward variety expansion
- Make a favicon, choose domain

### Stage 5 — Longer Bass Lines & Flow Loops

- Generate extended continuo lines (longer sequences)
- Introduce branching voicings / ornament choices
- Advanced scoring system factoring accuracy, speed, and stylistic rules
- Tighter feedback loops (shorter latency between input and reward)
- More complex audio/visual flourishes for jackpot hits

### Stage 6 — Orchestral Layering & Multi-Instrument Feedback

- Add pre-recorded/synthesized orchestral accompaniment
- Real-time audio feedback based on user's realized continuo
- Layered visual feedback (score animation, instrument cues)
- Dynamic scaling of reward magnitude with ensemble complexity
- Phase-based progression to keep “one more challenge” loop compelling

### Stage 7 — Social & Competitive Features

- Implement leaderboards (global/friends)
- Show streaks, ranks, and relative performance notifications
- Optional social comparison features (avatars, status badges)
- Limited-time weekly/daily challenges
- Unlock rare musical content for top performers

### Stage 8 — Identity & Engagement Optimization

- Experiment with fantasy identity framing (Virtuoso, Scholar, Assassin)
- Adjust audio/visual reward metaphors per identity
- Collect engagement data for identity A/B testing
- Tune reward probabilities, jackpot intensity, and pacing based on metrics
- Implement hybrid rewards (music + social + collectibles)

### Stage 9 — Full Orchestral Realization

- Multi-part orchestral textures fully driven by user input
- High-level challenges: modulations, tempo changes, complex ornaments
- Enhanced jackpot/flourish feedback for maximum engagement
- Full progression system visible: points, streaks, ranks, collectibles
- Adaptive difficulty scaling for skill retention and challenge
